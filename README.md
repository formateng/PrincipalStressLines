A Grasshopper plug-in which generates principal stress lines for optimised plate, slab, and shell structures.

The plug-in orginated from the Master's Thesis of Matthew Church at TU Delft conducted between 2020 and 2022. This original work and further details of the underlying principles of which the code is based can be found at: https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:b35b0984-1fbb-4f18-81d3-a01a8c9c8060

This code is based on the work of:
	Tam, K.M.M., 2015. Principal stress line computation for discrete topology design
	Jobard, B. and Lefer, W., 1997. Creating evenly-spaced streamlines of arbitrary density
	Mebarki, A., Alliez, P. and Devillers, O., 2005, October. Farthest point seeding for efficient placement of streamlines.
