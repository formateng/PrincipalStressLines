A Grasshopper plug-in which generates principal stress lines for optimised plate, slab, and shell structures.

The plug-in orginated from the Master's Thesis of Matthew Church at TU Delft conducted between 2020 and 2022. This original work and further details of the underlying principles of which the code is based can be found at: https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:b35b0984-1fbb-4f18-81d3-a01a8c9c8060
