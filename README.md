# LilyPad
A Grasshopper plug-in which generates principal stress lines for optimised plate, slab, and shell structures.

The plug-in orginated from the Master's Thesis of Matthew Church at TU Delft conducted between 2020 and 2022. This original work and further details of the underlying principles of which the code is based can be found at: https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:b35b0984-1fbb-4f18-81d3-a01a8c9c8060

## Licencing
Although Lilypad is provided as open source with an MIT license, the code is dependant on Triangle.NET which is based on Jonathan Richard Shewchuk's Triangle project. As a result there is ambiguity around how a derived work should be handled in regard to commerical licencing. Please refer to this [discussion](https://github.com/wo80/Triangle.NET/discussions/50) on Triangle.NET for more details.
